# isItReal

This is a fully built from scratch AI model that I am working on.
This is a project that will help me to refine my abilities in the world of AI and allow me to "dip my toes" into the world of AI and ML.
The final goal of this project is to create a Twitter bot that is able to be @'ed on an image. It then takes that image and determines if the image was AI generated or is a real image.

The purpose of this project is to help artists who are struggling in the field where genAI is creating artwork from stolen art and people are passing it off as art that they created themselves.

DISCLAIMERS:
Some of the training data used to train this AI may be your art. I am not an artist in the slightest, and considering some of you artists make some incredible work that takes years to master,
I will not be able to replicate it. I will try my best to ask for permission to use the art that you make, but that may not always be possible. There will be a folder that contains all of the 
artwork from artists inside of it. If you look through that folder and find a piece of your artwork and you do not want me to use it anymore, please contact me and I will remove it from the training data.
